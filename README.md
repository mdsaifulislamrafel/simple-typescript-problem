# Problem 1:
## The sumArray function takes an ES6 array of numbers (numbers: number[]) as input and returns a single number (number).

### Using the reduce Method: Inside the function, we’ve used the reduce method, which combines all elements in the array into a single value by summing them up. Here’s how it works:

* p (previous value) and c (current value) are parameters in the reduce method.
* For each element, reduce adds the current value to the previous total.
* Starting with zero, it sums all elements, ultimately returning the total sum.

```text
const sumArray = (numbers: number[]): number => {
    return numbers.reduce((p, c) => p + c, 0);
}

console.log(sumArray([2, 5, 4, 5, 5]));


```
